# FinanceTracker
In today's fast-paced world, effective personal finance management is crucial for achieving financial stability and achieving financial goals. Individuals, particularly students often struggle to keep track of their expenses, incomes and savings. This lack of financial awareness can lead to overspending, debt, and the inability to save and invest effectively. 
The "Personal Finance Tracker" project aims to address this problem by providing a user-friendly application to record, categorize, and analyze financial transactions.
